Holland is also a fun fact, we have provinces called Noord- &amp; Zuid-Holland. But the Dutch mostly don't name the Netherlands as Holland when we talk about our country.  
Here is a bit of history why this is the case though.  

&gt; A brief history of the Netherlands and Holland  

&gt; Between 1588 and 1795, the area currently representing the Netherlands was the Republic of Seven United Netherlands. The republic was conquered by French troops in 1795 and became the Batavian Republic. Napoleon appointed his brother Louis as king in 1806, turning the country into a kingdom. The Netherlands remained a kingdom after Napoleon’s defeat. At that time, the area called “Holland” made the biggest contribution to the entire nation’s economy and wealth. As such it became the commonly used name to indicate the entire country.",Clarify,Clarify,Clarify
